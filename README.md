# Notesbin Solid

:construction: This is an extremely WIP project. I'm rebuilding my note sharing project [notesbin](https://github.com/flashblaze/notesbin) to learn [Solid Start](https://start.solidjs.com/getting-started/what-is-solidstart) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io). Currently I haven't decided on the DB and provider yet, but I'll probably go with ~[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)~. Went with [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) 

I have used _with-prisma_ template of SolidStart to get the project up and running

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `pnpm i` to install the deps

Once done, run `pnpm dev` to start the project on port 3000

The notes.db contains some dummy data
