# Solid Notesbin

:construction: This is an extremely WIP project by rebuilding my note sharing project [notesbin](github.com/flashblaze/notesbin) to learn [Solid Start](https://start.solidjs.com/getting-started/what-is-solidstart) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io). Currently I haven't decided on the DB yet, but I'll probably go with [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/).

I have used *with-prisma* template of SolidStart to get the project up and running

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `pnpm i` to install the deps

Once done, run `pnpm dev` to start the project on port 3000

The notes.db contains some dummy data
